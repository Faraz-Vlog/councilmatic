This repo provides starter code &amp; documentation for new councilmatic instances.

## About Councilmatic

The [councilmatic family](https://www.councilmatic.org/) is a set of web apps for keeping tabs on city representatives and their legislative activity.

Councilmatic started as a Code for America project by Mjumbe Poe, who designed the earliest version of a Councilmatic site for [Philadelphia](http://philly.councilmatic.org/). DataMade then implemented Councilmatic in New York City (in partnership with the Participatory Politics Foundation), Chicago (in partnership with the Sunlight foundation), and Los Angeles (in partnership with the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority).

DataMade built `django-councilmatic` â€“ a django app with core functionality, common across all cities, which implements Open Civic Data (a data standard for describing people, organizations, events, and bills). The OCD data standard and the abstraciton of core functionality into a separate app simplifies the creation of Councilmatic sites.

Use this template to create a councilmatic app for a new city - analogous to DataMade projects, such as NYC Councimatic & Chicago Councilmatic.

## Get started

NOTE: This guide focuses on setting up your app for development. It does not discuss in detail the process of finding, scraping, and importing city data or deploying your site.

### Import data

You need data to build a Councilmatic instance. To do so, you should check that your city's data lives in the Open Civic Data API. Then, you need to write a scraper and an import script for loading data about people, legislation, events, etc. Much of what you need can be found in the [Open Civic Data documentation](https://opencivicdata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

### Create your site
:speech_balloon:

2. **fork this code**
  :speech_balloon:

2. **install stuff**
  :speech_balloon:

3. **update city-specific settings**
  - set your `OCD_JURISDICTION_ID`.
    you can find the jurisdiction ids at http://ocd.datamade.us/jurisdictions/
  - set either `OCD_CITY_COUNCIL_ID` or `OCD_CITY_COUNCIL_NAME` - this identifies your city council
    `OCD_CITY_COUNCIL_ID` will take precedence over `OCD_CITY_COUNCIL_NAME`, but it may make more sense to set `OCD_CITY_COUNCIL_NAME` if your OCD IDs aren't persistent. You can find the name and id of your city council at http://ocd.datamade.us/organizations/?jurisdiction_id=YOUR_JURISDICTION_ID
  - :speech_balloon:

4. **update deployment settings**
  :speech_balloon:

5. **set up your database**
  :speech_balloon:

6. **import data**
  :speech_balloon:

7. **run the app!**
  :speech_balloon:





To use this template, you'll need to have your city's data in the Open Civic
Data API. How you get your data into an instance of the OCD API is up to you.
In the case of New York City and Chicago, there are scrapers which run nightly
to update the API by scraping the data from the Legistar backed sites operated
by those cities. If the city that you are interested in building a Councilmatic
instance for happens to be running a Legistar backed site, checkout
[`python-legistar-scraper`](https://github.com/opencivicdata/python-legistar-scraper)
and the [`pupa`](https://github.com/opencivicdata/pupa) framework to get a head
start on scraping those sites (for examples of how to customize your scraper,
look at
[`scrapers-us-municipal`](https://github.com/opencivicdata/scrapers-us-municipal)).
[DataMade](https://datamade.us/) hosts several municipal level scrapers.
Information about what cities and other governmental bodies are already covered
can be seen at
[`http://ocd.datamade.us/jurisdictions/`](http://ocd.datamade.us/jurisdictions/).

## Quick start guide

NOTE: This is not yet a comprehensive overview of how to customize councilmatic
:speech_balloon: or how to deploy a live site :speech_balloon:.

1. **Install OS Level dependencies**

* Python 3.4
* PostgreSQL 9.4 +

2. **Clone this project and make it your own**
```
git clone https://github.com/datamade/councilmatic-starter-template.git yourcity_councilmatic
```

3. **Make a virtualenv and install dependencies**

We recommend using [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
and
[virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
for working in a virtualized development environment. [Read how to set up
virtualenv](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/).

Once you have virtualenvwrapper set up,

```
mkvirtualenv councilmatic
cd yourcity_councilmatic
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Rename app**

Inside the git repository that you cloned above, you should see a
folder called `yourcity`. Rename that to something that makes sense
for you:

```
mv yourcity chicago
```

Now make sure that you update the main `settings.py` file for the
project inside the `councilmatic` folder:

```
# Find the INSTALLED_APPS list and change 'yourcity' to whatever you
# named it above ('chicago' in the example)

INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...
    ~'yourcity',~
    'chicago',
)
```

4. **update city-specific settings**

In the `councilmatic` folder you'll find a settings file called
`settings_jursidiction.py`.These are all the jurisdiction specific settings that will tell your
Councilmatic instance how to populate different parts of the UI and get fresh
data from the OCD API. :speech_balloon:

                If your city's scraper is hosted on the Datamade OCD API, you can

                [http://ocd.datamade.us/jurisdictions/](http://ocd.datamade.us/jurisdictions/).
                Otherwise, look at the `/jurisdictions/` endpoint of the [OCD
                API](https://github.com/opencivicdata/api.opencivicdata.org) where
                your data is hosted.

4. **update deployment settings**

In the `councilmatic` folder you'll find another settings file called
`settings_deployment.py.example`. Make a copy of it so that you can
customize it for your city:

```
cp councilmatic/settings_deployment.py.example councilmatic/settings_deployment.py
```

This is where you'll keep the parts of your Councilmatic that you
don't want to place into version control (things like passwords,
database connection strings, etc that will vary based on where
the app is running and which you probably won't want other people to
know). Most of them are generic Django settings which you can look up
in the [Django
docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/ref/settings/). The ones
that aren't are:

        <tr>

                in `django-councilmatic` to clear Django's cache.

                images of members of the legislative body that are
                often available through Legistar.
