## About Councilmatic

The [councilmatic family](https://www.councilmatic.org/) is a set of web apps for keeping tabs on city representatives and their legislative activity.

Councilmatic started as a Code for America project by Mjumbe Poe, who designed the earliest version of a Councilmatic site for [Philadelphia](http://philly.councilmatic.org/). DataMade then implemented Councilmatic in New York City (in partnership with the Participatory Politics Foundation), Chicago (in partnership with the Sunlight foundation), and Los Angeles (in partnership with the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority).

DataMade built `django-councilmatic` â€“ a django app with core functionality, common across all cities, which implements Open Civic Data (a data standard for describing people, organizations, events, and bills). The OCD data standard and the abstraciton of core functionality into a separate app simplifies the creation of Councilmatic sites.

Use this template to create a councilmatic app for a new city - analogous to DataMade projects, such as NYC Councimatic & Chicago Councilmatic.

## Get started

NOTE: This guide focuses on setting up your app for development. It does not discuss in detail the process of finding, scraping, and importing city data or deploying your site.

### Get data

You need data about your city in the Open Civic Data API.

How you get your data into an instance of the OCD API is up to you. What does DataMade do? We use scrapers, which run nightly to update the API by scraping the data from Legistar-backed sites operated by NYC, Chicago, and LA Metro. Your city may be running a Legistar-backed site, and if so, you can checkout [`python-legistar-scraper`](https://github.com/opencivicdata/python-legistar-scraper) and the [`pupa`](https://github.com/opencivicdata/pupa) framework to get a head start on scraping those sites.

If you need examples of how to customize your scraper, look at [`scrapers-us-municipal`](https://github.com/opencivicdata/scrapers-us-municipal)) as well as [DataMade](https://datamade.us/), which hosts several municipal-level scrapers. You can find information about what cities and other governmental bodies are already covered at [`http://ocd.datamade.us/jurisdictions/`](http://ocd.datamade.us/jurisdictions/).

### Create your site

1. **Install OS Level dependencies**

* Python 3.4
* PostgreSQL 9.4 +

2. **Clone this project and make it your own**
```
git clone https://github.com/datamade/councilmatic-starter-template.git yourcity_councilmatic
```

3. **Make a virtualenv and install dependencies**

We recommend using [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
and
[virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
for working in a virtualized development environment. [Read how to set up
virtualenv](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/).

Once you have virtualenvwrapper set up, do the following in your bash profile:

```bash
mkvirtualenv councilmatic
cd yourcity_councilmatic
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Rename the "city" app**

Inside the git repository that you cloned above, you should see a folder called `city`. Rename that to something that makes sense for your project, e.g., "chicago."

```bash
mv city chicago
```

Now, update the main settings file - `councilmatic/settings.py`. First, add the new name of the folder that you just changed to INSTALLED_APPS.

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...
    ~'city',~
    'chicago',
)
```

Then, change the TIME_ZONE. You can use [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) to find the correct formatting.

```python
TIME_ZONE = 'America/Chicago'
```

5. **update city-specific settings**

In the `councilmatic` folder you'll find a settings file called `settings_jursidiction.py`. These settings tell your Councilmatic instance how to populate different parts of the UI and get fresh data from the OCD API.

    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <!-- <th>Example value</th> -->
            <th>Optional?</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>`OCD_JURISDICTION_ID`</td>
            <td>
                For scrapers hosted on the Datamade OCD API, you can
                find the jurisdiction id at
                [http://ocd.datamade.us/jurisdictions/](http://ocd.datamade.us/jurisdictions/).

                Otherwise, look at the `/jurisdictions/` endpoint of the [OCD
                API](https://github.com/opencivicdata/api.opencivicdata.org).

                **Example**
                ocd-jurisdiction/country:us/state:il/place:chicago/government
            </td>
            <!-- <td>ocd-jurisdiction/country:us/state:il/place:chicago/government</td> -->

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>`OCD_CITY_COUNCIL_ID`</td>
            <td>
                Set either `OCD_CITY_COUNCIL_ID` or `OCD_CITY_COUNCIL_NAME` - this
                identifies your city council `OCD_CITY_COUNCIL_ID` will take precedence over
                `OCD_CITY_COUNCIL_NAME`, but it may make more sense to set
                `OCD_CITY_COUNCIL_NAME` if your OCD IDs aren't persistent. You can find the
                name and id of your city council on the Datamade OCD API at
                http://ocd.datamade.us/organizations/?jurisdiction_id=YOUR_JURISDICTION_ID
                (or using the same path on your own OCD API)

4. **update deployment settings**

In the `councilmatic` folder you'll find another settings file called
`settings_deployment.py.example`. Make a copy of it so that you can
customize it for your city:

```
cp councilmatic/settings_deployment.py.example councilmatic/settings_deployment.py
```

This is where you'll keep the parts of your Councilmatic that you
don't want to place into version control (things like passwords,
database connection strings, etc that will vary based on where
the app is running and which you probably won't want other people to
know). Most of them are generic Django settings which you can look up
in the [Django
docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/ref/settings/). The ones
that aren't are:

        <tr>

        </tr>

                in `django-councilmatic` to clear Django's cache.

            <td>`HEADSHOT_PATH`</td>

                Absolute path to where the data loader will save
                images of members of the legislative body that are
                often available through Legistar.

                List of additional django apps that you want to use
                with your custom councilmatic
